# Grocery List Coding Challenge

## Objective
Using your knowledge of arrays, make a grocery list app that functions like [this](https://hstatsep-js.github.io/grocery-list-cc/hidden.html).

## Directions
1. After you have your own copy of the repo, all group members should clone the repo into `/js/classwork/`.
2. Follow the directions in `script.js`
3. Roles: everyone is a thinker, but they should be "driving" at different points. The first person should drive for Task 1. They `push`, the partner(s) `pull`, then switch roles. Repeat for all tasks!

Happy coding!
